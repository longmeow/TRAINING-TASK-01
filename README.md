- Raspberry Pi operates as a router with DHCP server, connecting remaining entities in IoT testbed.
- 2 nodeMCU boards send their data collected by sensors to host by network protocol of choice (in particular, we use HTTP).
- Host output received data of each zone to the respective .csv file.
- Another PC use an attack tool (in this case - Slowloris) to perform DoS attack targeting (entities) and observe system behaviors.
